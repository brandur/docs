* On oversimplification:

    > But if the musical’s director aim was to present oversimplified truths
    > for the sake of social justice, the main antagonists shouldn’t have been
    > evil politicians and tech executives—it should have been property owners
    > gleefully watching the value of their biggest assets skyrocket as they
    > aggressively blocked high-density development.

* On a more accurate version of the kindergarten play:

    > The homeowners see themselves as upright “preservationists,” protecting
    > the character of their city even as they turn it into a time-capsule for
    > the old and rich. In my propaganda play, they’d be sympathetic with the
    > plight of the working class, but wouldn’t value them nearly as much as
    > living amidst refurbished Victorians. They’d prevail by tricking
    > economically illiterate activists into allying with them after sneakily
    > tearing the supply-and-demand chapters from their econ textbooks.

* On tenants groups:

    > Then the rent-controlled tenants care far more about eviction protections
    > than increasing supply. That’s because their most vulnerable constituents
    > are paying rents that are so far below market-rate, that only an ungodly
    > amount of construction could possibly help them.
