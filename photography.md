### Crop Factor with ISO and Aperture

* Focal length: divide by crop factor (full-frame of 50 mm is Micro Four-Thirds
  of 25 mm).
* Aperture: crop factor affects depth-of-field (Micro Four-Thirds has twice the
  depth-of-field or half the background blur).
* ISO: noise is proportional to crop factor _squared_ (full-frame ISO 200 has
  similar noise to Micro Four-Thirds at ISO 800).
