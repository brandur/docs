* On block size:

    > The block chain is full. You may wonder how it is possible for what is
    > essentially a series of files to be “full”. The answer is that an
    > entirely artificial capacity cap of one megabyte per block, put in place
    > as a temporary kludge a long time ago, has not been removed and as a
    > result the network’s capacity is now almost completely exhausted.

* On three payments per second maximum throughput:

    > The peak level in July was reached during a denial-of-service attack in
    > which someone flooded the network with transactions in an attempt to
    > break things, calling it a “stress test”. So that level, about 700
    > kilobytes of transactions (or less than 3 payments per second), is
    > probably about the limit of what Bitcoin can actually achieve in practice

* On reduced block size:

    > The reason the true limit seems to be 700 kilobytes instead of the
    > theoretical 1000 is that sometimes miners produce blocks smaller than
    > allowed and even empty blocks, despite that there are lots of
    > transactions waiting to confirm — this seems to be most frequently caused
    > by interference from the Chinese “Great Firewall” censorship system.

* On the lack of distribution of hashing power:

    > Why has the capacity limit not been raised? Because the block chain is
    > controlled by Chinese miners, just two of whom control more than 50% of
    > the hash power. At a recent conference over 95% of hashing power was
    > controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stage. The miners are
    > not allowing the block chain to grow.
