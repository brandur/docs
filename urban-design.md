### A Freeway-Free San Francisco

* Foon Sien Wong in 1967 on the subject of the San Francisco freeways:

    > They are not simply interfering with Chinatown. They are sticking a concrete
    > knife into its heart. The city officials cannot, or will not, understand that
    > they are not just dealing with streets and buildings. They are dealing in
    > human lives, in a unique ethnic community, too fragile to survive a policy
    > that puts pavement ahead of people.

* On the long term effects of removal:

    > But disinvestment is not forever. Our work has shown that whenever an urban
    > freeway has been removed, adjacent neighborhoods tend to improve. The traffic
    > chaos that is nearly always predicted rarely materializes. Few residents
    > would advocate for putting these free ways back.
