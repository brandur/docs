> As with financial debt, a small amount, taken on with eyes wide open can be a
> good thing. But also like financial debt, it compounds over time. A little
> bit of technical debt taken on when you were ten or a hundred engineers, left
> on the books, will be killing you when you’re a thousand engineers.

> During the “let a thousand flowers bloom” phase people will have planted all
> kinds of exotic blossoms, some of which are lovely and even well adapted to
> their local micro-climate; you need to be able to decide which ones are going
> to be first class, nurtured members of your garden and which ones are weeds.
