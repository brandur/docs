* On Rice Energy:

    > Rice Energy (RICE), a natural gas producer with a low credit rating,
    > raised $900 million in a bond sale in April, $150 million more than it
    > originally sought. Investors snapped up the bonds even though the
    > Canonsburg (Pa.)-based company has lost money three years in a row, has
    > drilled fewer than 50 wells (most named after superheroes and monster
    > trucks), and said it will spend $4.09 for every dollar it earns (before
    > interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) in 2014.

* On drilling technology:

    > The U.S. drive for energy independence is backed by a surge in junk bonds
    > that has been as vital to the boom as the breakthroughs in drilling
    > technology.

* On investment money:

    > “There’s a lot of Kool-Aid that’s being drunk now by investors,” says Tim
    > Gramatovich, chief investment officer of Peritus Asset Management.
    > “People lose their discipline. They stop doing the math. They stop doing
    > the accounting. They’re just dreaming the dream, and that’s what’s
    > happening with the shale boom.”

* On capital markets:

    > Ivan Sandrea, a research associate at the Oxford Institute for Energy
    > Studies in England, wrote in a March report. “The benevolence of the U.S.
    > capital markets cannot last forever.”

* On the declining output of shale wells:

    > Since output from shale wells drops sharply in the first year, producers
    > have to keep drilling more wells just to maintain production. That means
    > more borrowing. “This is a melting ice cube business,” says Mike Kelly,
    > an energy analyst at Global Hunter Securities in Houston. “If you’re not
    > growing production, you’re dying.”
